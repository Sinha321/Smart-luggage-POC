# Human Following & Obstacle Avoidance Luggage (POC)

In this project we present a prototype proof of concept that uses Arduino Uno along with sensors. It can follow humans and carry their luggage at the same time it can avoid the interference of other humans or animals that passes in between. 

Our objective is to serve old people and medical centers or handicaped people to get the benefits of this automated robot. This robot will serve as a luggage carrier that can lift upto 20 kgs of weight or as a shopping cart. In medical centers this robot serves handicapped people as a wheel chair that follows the nurse or as an emergency bed.

## Introduction and Objective

A four wheel luggage carrier robot that can automatically mimic some human movements and functions like moving back left right and front with humans. To follow a person within a certain distance and avoid obstacles at the same time. 
Everyone tries to carry less baggage as it assures comfort but at times we donâ€™t have a choice other than carrying huge and heavy luggages for long distance travel. A shopping-time robot that carries goods and walks behind people without a controller would be more helpful.

#### The main objectives are : 
* Luggage Carrier and Follower
* Automated Wheel Chair at Hospitals
